# OpenCV@Python

# Goals:
Using the camera, acquire the user photo, use libs to detect face position and characteristics. Extract important info from the image into a 128 position floating poinyt array - to be stored (in a database) and compared.

# Operations:
The camera can be used to get the image, process and obtain the template array and save in a dataBase with some extra information, like the name.
A face recognition solution can be done comparing the camera content to the database and FINDING the most suitable candidate - with the name.
